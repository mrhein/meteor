=> Meteor 0.8.2: Switch `accounts-password` to use bcrypt on the
   server. User accounts will seamlessly transition to bcrypt on the
   next login, but this transition is one-way, so you cannot downgrade a
   production app once you upgrade to 0.8.2.

   This release is being downloaded in the background. Update your
   project to Meteor 0.8.2 by running 'meteor update'.
